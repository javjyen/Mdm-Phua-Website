<p>Dear Mdm Phua,<br><br> 

Happy belated birthday!<br><br>

Firstly, we would like to thank you for being so patient and always showering us with your love. Every day at school, you always care for our well-being and make us feel loved.<br><br>

At our 'second home', you become our second mum and treat us like your own children. We know that it's really hard trying to teach all forty of us, and engage us during lessons. Therefore, we apologise if we have hurt your feelings in any way. We truly appreciate your guidance and care for us. Thank you so much, for everything that you have done for us.<br><br>

Last but not least, we wish you all the best, and hope that you will stay happy and healthy. Happy belated birthday!<br><br>

Love,<br>
P6.4 (2021)<br>
P.S. P6.4 FOREVER! ðŸ™‚</p>
